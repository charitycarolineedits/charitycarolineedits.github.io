        <p>If you're looking for help with your writing, but don't know exactly how I can help, you're in the right place! Below is a comprehensive list of my services, along with descriptions, and my rates. </p>
        
        <ul> <div id= "services">
            <li><h2>Developmental Editing</h2><p> For this type of editing I will take a look at your story as a whole and give you suggestions for how you can better tell it. I'll give you suggestions on how to develop the story, fix plot holes, and strengthen key themes in your writing.<br><em>Rate:</em> $0.020–$0.030 per word.</p></li>
            <li><h2>Substantive Editing</h2><p> This type of editing is sometimes called "line editing" meaning  I will look through the phrasing of the lines and paragraphs of your work. I will give detailed edits on how to rephrase and restructure text you've already written to help with clarity and flow. <br><em>Rate: $0.015–$0.030 per word.</em></p></li>
            <li><h2>Copy Editing</h2> <p>Copy editing will look like me going over your manuscript with a fine-tooth comb to fix the grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and spelling of your manuscript. The style guide I use for reference will depend on your genre, but I am well-versed in Chicago, APA, and MLA. <br><em>Rate: $0.015–$0.025 per word.</em> </p></li>
            <li><h2>Proofreading</h2><p> For this service I will look over the complete manuscript and check for any final formatting errors. I will make formatting suggestions for the book and do a final pass-through to ensure there are no little mistakes.<br><em>Rate: $0.0075–$0.015 per word.</em></li>
            <li><h2>Quick Consultations/Other</h2><p> If you're unsure of which service or combination of services are right for your book, we can do a zoom call and answer any questions you have! This call will help us know how we can help each other. You can also use this call as a query letter review where I can show you how to tweak your letter to make it more marketable. <br><em> Rate: $1 per minute.</em></p></li>
