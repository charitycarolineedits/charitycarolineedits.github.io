                    The following two samples are proofreading work I did with a freelance copyeditor who edits clean middle-grade fantasy. Some pieces had been line edited beforehand, and some hadnâ€™t. My job was just to fix punctuation and make changes for clarity.

                    This is a sample of a transcript I edited for the Come Back Podcast. My editing work here was unique because I was editing a podcast transcript that had been transcribed by AI to be sent to a translation team. My task was to clean up the document so they could efficiently translate the episodes into French and Spanish. I worked to preserve the speaker's message while also standardizing grammar and punctuation, adding tone/expression tags, removing filler words, and rewriting idioms to their literal meanings.

                    This is an article I copyedited for a language and linguistics journal. This is the Winter 2023 issue that I worked on. I helped with all stages of production, but here I helped design the cover and place the figures in the journal.

                    This was an article I edited for my nonfiction editing class. The content of the article was engaging and informative. My main goal was to edit it for cohesion and concision.

                    This is a brief example of the type of copyediting I did at BYU Continuing Education. I typically checked for accuracy, proper citations, and clarity in the courses.
